# LLVM - C++

## Luiggy Mamani Condori

It's a set of tools that we can use to compile a language to an intermediate language (IR) and this can be assembled for different processors.

So what you can do is assemble or disassemble binary code to the intermediate language which is a .ll

## Assemble and Disassemble

LLVM allows us to assemble the intermediate code generated by a frontend tool like Clang into Bytecode:

```

clang++ -S -emit-llvm test.cpp

llvm-as test.ll

```

But we can also disassemble the intermediate code to have the intermediate code again:

```

llvm-dis test.bc -o test-2.ll

```

## Use for console

This is an idea that occurred to me to implement using the LLVM tools based on the idea of our console, which is to convert the code of an implemented game to binary code using LLVM and then from the console use the tools to:

1. Load the implemented game but in binary code. _(With what was mentioned above to disassemble the code)_.
2. Then I need a way to find the method I want to execute, this method can be a method that builds the implemented Game.

    I found information to execute code that is inside a .ll from the C++ language, where we can use LLVM tools such as **EngineBuilder** and **ExecutionEngine**

    ### Example

    To explain it better I will give an example, imagine that you have a car and you want to drive it, then you need the car key that helps you _"prepare"_ the car so that you can drive it (go forward, reverse or other functionality), in other words, Before you can use the car you need to prepare it.

    ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.ecd1fbfc6c377f72eb4a4f3b1720e941?rik=KJYiP4viVU4bHQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.atraccion360.com%2fmedia%2faa%2fimages%2f2015%2f11%2fllaves-del-coche-consejos-5.jpg&ehk=%2fp2l3ryqJkMDWeHxsD3k1frU4D4QrZLuGLrsl8oAAh8%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)

    In this case **EngineBuilder** is the key to the car because it will help us prepare the .ll file so that we can then execute it and the **ExecutionEngine** helps us execute specific parts of the .ll file

    Using these two tools we can read the game instructions and execute them.
